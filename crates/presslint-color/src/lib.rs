/// - `Preserve` resolves to [`OverprintDecision::Preserve`] regardless of the

/// - `RejectUnsafe` resolves to [`OverprintDecision::NoUnsafeOverprint`] when

///   to [`OverprintDecision::Rejected`] with
///   [`OverprintRejection::UnsafeOverprintSensitiveConversions`]. Rejected
///   observations preserve caller iteration order.
/// - `Mitigate` ignores [`OverprintSensitivity::Safe`] observations and
///   partitions unsafe observations in a single pass. Process colorant expansion
///   and spot colorant conversion become supported report-only mitigations;
///   unsupported interactions become explicit skips. Both lists preserve caller
///   iteration order.
