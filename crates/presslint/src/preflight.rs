//! [`check_no_rgb_in_print`] builds the backend-neutral [`PdfInventory`] with
//! [`build_pdf_inventory`], then scans the merged, page-ordered inventory once
//! and applies a fixed prepress color policy: `DeviceRGB` in marking content is
//! an error, `DeviceCMYK`/`DeviceGray` are pass-compatible, every other observed
//! color space needs human review, and three honesty signals record where the
//! current engine cannot yet see (skipped pages, undecoded image color, and
//! un-recursed Form `XObject` content).
//!
//! This is a read-only check. It lives in the umbrella crate, not
//! `presslint-actions`: it plans nothing, mutates nothing, and retains no PDF
//! source bytes beyond the owned [`PdfInventory`] moved into the report.
