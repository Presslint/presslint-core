## Current State

### T088 - Bounded FlateDecode Stream Decoding

- Added a focused `/FlateDecode` stream helper that accepts borrowed compressed
  bytes plus explicit decode parameters and returns bounded owned decoded
  bytes for downstream tokenizer/inventory consumers.
- The helper uses pinned `miniz_oxide =0.9.1` with default features disabled
  and only the allocation feature enabled. Inflate uses the zlib-wrapped
  bounded API, so over-limit output becomes a structured rejection instead of
  unbounded allocation.
- Supported predictor cases are no predictor / `/Predictor 1`, TIFF Predictor
  2, and PNG predictors 10-15. Predictor failures are explicit for unsupported
  predictors, malformed parameters, row geometry mismatches, integer overflow,
  and unknown PNG filter bytes.
- The owned decoded buffer is intentional at this seam: decompression creates a
  new byte stream. Predictor reversal avoids an additional decoded copy; PNG
  rows are compacted in place after filter reversal.
- Non-goals remain unchanged: no xref streams, no filter arrays or chained
  filters, no additional PDF filters, no recompression or mutation, no object
  maps/caches/document opener, and no inventory/action/color work.

### T089 - Inspect Cross-Reference Stream Dictionary Geometry Fields

- Adds `inspect_xref_stream_dictionary(input, object_byte_offset)`, the first
  cross-reference-stream (`/Type /XRef`) slice. Given caller bytes and the byte
  offset of an indirect object (the offset `classify_xref_section` reports as
  `XrefSection::Stream`), it extracts the geometry fields a later step needs to
  slice the eventually-decoded entry table: `/Type` (must be `/XRef`), `/W` (the
  three field widths), `/Size`, and `/Index` (the subsection pairs).
- It delegates the object header and top-level entry spans to
  `inspect_indirect_object_dictionary`, reimplementing no header, body-token,
  dictionary-open, or entry-span scanning, and matches only the exact raw key
  bytes `/Type`, `/W`, `/Size`, and `/Index` the same way
  `inspect_classic_xref_trailer_root` matches `/Root` (one shared
  `unique_entry` helper reports missing as `Ok(None)`, exactly-one as
  `Ok(Some)`, and more-than-one as a duplicate-key error).
- `/Type` must be exactly one name value whose raw bytes are `/XRef`; a missing,
  duplicate, non-name, or non-`/XRef` `/Type` is a distinct rejection
  (`MissingType`, `DuplicateType`, `NonNameTypeValue`, `UnexpectedTypeName`).
- `/W` must be exactly one array value, located with `inspect_array_extent` and
  scanned by the one new bounded abstraction: a whitespace/comment-separated
  decimal-integer element scan over the located array extent. Exactly three
  non-negative integers are required and a width of `0` (omitted field) is
  accepted; missing, duplicate, non-array, malformed-array, malformed-element,
  width-overflow, and wrong-length cases are distinct rejections (`MissingW`,
  `DuplicateW`, `NonArrayWValue`, `MalformedWArray`, `MalformedWElement`,
  `WidthOutOfRange`, `WrongWLength`).
- `/Size` must be exactly one direct non-negative integer that fits `usize`;
  missing, duplicate, non-integer (any non-pure-digit value span, including an
  indirect `N G R` or a decimal), and out-of-range cases are distinct
  rejections (`MissingSize`, `DuplicateSize`, `NonIntegerSizeValue`,
  `SizeOutOfRange`).
- `/Index` is optional: when absent it defaults to a single `(0, Size)`
  subsection with `index_value_range` `None`; when present it must be one array
  of an even count of non-negative integers parsed as
  `(first_object_number, entry_count)` pairs, and a duplicate, non-array,
  malformed-array, malformed-element, odd-length, or integer-overflow `/Index`
  is a distinct rejection (`DuplicateIndex`, `NonArrayIndexValue`,
  `MalformedIndexArray`, `MalformedIndexElement`, `OddIndexLength`,
  `IndexIntegerOutOfRange`). Geometry is never fabricated when the key is
  present but malformed.
- `XrefStreamDictionaryInspection` carries the delegated
  `IndirectObjectDictionaryInspection`, the `/Type` key/value byte ranges, the
  `/W` value byte range and parsed `widths`, the `/Size` value byte range and
  parsed `size`, and the `/Index` value byte range (when present) plus the
  ordered `index_subsections`. It retains or copies no PDF bytes, object bodies,
  stream bodies, decoded bytes, or source slices; the only owned allocations are
  the three-element `widths` vector and the small `index_subsections` pair
  vector (the acceptable copy budget for bounded report materialization), so no
  benchmark was added.
- Every failure path is a distinct structured rejection variant and the helper
  never returns partial geometry on error. It lives in the new focused
  `xref_stream.rs` module, re-exported from `lib.rs`; tests live in
  `src/tests/xref_stream.rs`.
- A composition test chains `inspect_startxref -> classify_xref_section
  (== XrefSection::Stream) -> inspect_xref_stream_dictionary` over a synthetic
  xref-stream fixture and confirms `/Type /XRef`, the three `/W` widths,
  `/Size`, and the defaulted/explicit `/Index` subsections; a serde round-trip
  test pins the public JSON shape of the report and rejection enum.
- Non-goals for this slice: no decoding/inflating/reading of the cross-reference
  stream body bytes, no `/W`-width entry-record parsing or object offset map, no
  `/Root` or `/Prev` parsing, no `/Prev` following, incremental-section merging,
  or hybrid-reference (`/XRefStm`) support, no indirect-reference resolution,
  catalog/page-tree/`/Contents` reading, no stream-data extent location or
  `endstream` validation, and no filesystem I/O, document opener, caches, object
  maps, or whole-document eager parsing.
- Ablation (behavior-preserving): the four field-requirement helpers
  (`require_type`/`require_widths`/`require_size`/`require_index`) no longer take
  a generic `E: Fn(..) -> Error + Copy` error closure with the same four-line
  bound repeated verbatim; they take a small `Copy` `ErrorContext` struct whose
  `error(reason, offset)` method builds the rejection. This removes the generic
  parameter from every helper, the closure built in
  `inspect_xref_stream_dictionary`, the free `xref_stream_error` constructor, and
  the four single-use `duplicate_*` variant wrappers (their duplicate-key ranges
  are now destructured inline at each call site). No public type, field, serde
  shape, rejection variant, error offset, or behavior changed; all `xref_stream`
  tests, the full `presslint-pdf` suite, `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`,
  clippy, and `./scripts/ci_check.sh` pass unchanged.

### T090 - Inspect Cross-Reference Stream Trailer Navigation Fields

- Adds `inspect_xref_stream_trailer(input, object_byte_offset)`, the next
  cross-reference-stream slice. Given caller bytes and the byte offset of an
  xref-stream indirect object (the offset `classify_xref_section` reports as
  `XrefSection::Stream`), it reads the trailer-style navigation fields that let
  the structural path continue from an xref stream: `/Root` (the catalog) and
  optional `/Prev` (the previous cross-reference byte offset).
- It delegates `/Type /XRef`, `/W`, `/Size`, and `/Index` geometry validation to
  `inspect_xref_stream_dictionary`, reimplementing none of it, and scans only the
  exact raw top-level keys `/Root` and `/Prev` over the entries that geometry
  inspection already materialized (via `inspect_indirect_object_dictionary`). The
  exact-key, missing/duplicate semantics reuse the shared `unique_entry` helper
  from `xref_stream`, and the `/Prev` byte offset reuses the same
  `parse_non_negative_integer` helper that module applies to `/Size` (both `pub`,
  crate-internal because the module is private).
- `/Root` is required and must be exactly one top-level `N G R` indirect
  reference that covers its entire value span, parsed with
  `parse_indirect_reference`; it is reported as an `IndirectRef` plus its key and
  value byte ranges. Missing, duplicate, non-reference (name/number/dict/array),
  and malformed-reference (`obj` keyword or trailing scalar) cases are distinct
  rejections (`MissingRoot`, `DuplicateRoot`, `NonReferenceRootValue`,
  `MalformedRootReference`).
- `/Prev` is optional and must be at most one top-level direct non-negative
  decimal-integer byte offset that fits `usize`, reported with its value byte
  range and parsed `prev_byte_offset` when present. Duplicate, non-integer
  (indirect reference, decimal, signed, name, array, dictionary), and
  integer-overflow cases are distinct rejections (`DuplicatePrev`,
  `NonIntegerPrevValue`, `PrevOutOfRange`); when `/Prev` is absent both report
  fields are `None`.
- `XrefStreamTrailerInspection` carries the delegated
  `XrefStreamDictionaryInspection`, the `/Root` key/value byte ranges and parsed
  `root_reference`, and the optional `/Prev` value byte range and parsed
  `prev_byte_offset`. It retains or copies no PDF bytes, object bodies, stream
  bodies, or source slices; its only owned data are the delegated inspection's
  bounded vectors, byte ranges, an `IndirectRef`, and small `usize` values, so no
  benchmark was added. Every failure path is a distinct structured rejection and
  the helper never returns partial navigation fields on error.
- It lives in the new focused `xref_stream_trailer.rs` module, re-exported from
  `lib.rs`; tests live in `src/tests/xref_stream_trailer.rs` and cover `/Root`
  success, `/Root` + `/Prev` success, missing/duplicate/non-reference/malformed
  `/Root`, duplicate/non-integer/overflow `/Prev`, delegated-geometry-failure
  propagation, a `inspect_startxref -> classify_xref_section
  (== XrefSection::Stream) -> inspect_xref_stream_trailer` composition case, a
  no-retained-bytes check, and a serde round-trip pinning the report and
  rejection JSON shape.
- Non-goals for this slice: no cross-reference stream body decoding or
  entry-record parsing, no `/W`-width record slicing or object-offset map, no
  `/Prev` following, incremental-section merging, or hybrid-reference
  (`/XRefStm`) support, no `/Root` resolution or catalog/page-tree traversal, and
  no filesystem I/O, document opener, caches, or whole-document eager parsing.

## Follow-Ups

- Next C slice: decode the xref-stream body (via the T088 FlateDecode helper) and
  slice it into `/W`-width entry records over the `/Index` subsections, then
  resolve `/Root` and follow the `/Prev` chain to merge incremental sections.
