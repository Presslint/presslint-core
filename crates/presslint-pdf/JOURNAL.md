# presslint-pdf Journal

## Current State

- Defines initial structural PDF access data contracts for indirect references
  and document info.
- Adds bounded source inspection over caller-provided bytes:
  `inspect_pdf_source` reports total byte length, `%PDF-M.N` header offset and
  version from a fixed leading window, and final `startxref` offset from a fixed
  trailing window when the marker, decimal offset, and `%%EOF` are present.
- Classifies the cross-reference section style at the resolved `startxref`
  offset: a bounded window (`XREF_SECTION_SCAN_LIMIT`) read at that offset is
  reported as a classic `xref` table (`XrefSection::Table`) when it begins,
  after optional PDF whitespace, with the `xref` keyword, or as a
  cross-reference stream (`XrefSection::Stream`) carrying the parsed object and
  generation numbers when it begins with an `N G obj` indirect object header.
  An out-of-bounds offset, an unrecognized shape, or object/generation numbers
  that do not fit `u32`/`u16` produce a non-fatal `XrefSectionUnclassified`
  diagnostic and leave the classification absent. This never reads table
  entries, the trailer dictionary, the stream dictionary, or any object body,
  and never follows `/Prev` chains or earlier xref sections.
- Adds `inspect_classic_xref_table`, a bounded helper for caller-provided bytes
  and an expected classic `xref` table offset. It reports the `xref` keyword
  byte offset, subsections in source order, fixed-width entries in deterministic
  object-number order within each subsection, each entry's object number,
  generation, byte offset, free/in-use state, and the byte offset where the
  following `trailer` keyword begins. The helper stops at `trailer` and does
  not parse or retain the trailer dictionary.
- Classic xref table inspection returns structured public errors for
  out-of-bounds offsets, non-table offsets, malformed subsection headers,
  malformed entries, numeric range failures, subsection object-number overflow,
  and missing trailers.
- Regression coverage pins exact-EOF keyword handling: a `trailer` keyword at
  EOF is accepted, while bare `xref` input with or without trailing whitespace
  reports `MissingTrailer`.
- Regression coverage also pins fixed-width entry termination: a short
  `offset generation state` entry followed by a blank line is still rejected as
  `MalformedEntry`.
- Adds `resolve_classic_xref_object`, a pure locate-only helper over an existing
  `ClassicXrefTableInspection`. It reports in-use, free, not-found, and
  ambiguous object-number results without reading source bytes, doing I/O,
  allocating a lookup map, or parsing object bodies.
- Adds `inspect_indirect_object_header`, a bounded helper for caller-provided
  bytes and an expected indirect object byte offset. It skips optional PDF
  whitespace, reports the parsed `IndirectRef`, the resolved header start, the
  header byte range through the `obj` keyword, and the byte immediately after
  `obj`. It validates public numeric ranges and returns structured errors for
  out-of-bounds offsets, malformed headers, and object/generation range
  failures without retaining PDF bytes or parsing object bodies.
- Adds `inspect_indirect_object_body_token`, a pure report-only helper for
  caller-provided bytes and an expected indirect object body offset. It skips
  PDF whitespace, reports the resolved first-token byte offset, and classifies
  only the broad leading token family: dictionary open `<<`, hex-string open
  `<`, array open, name, literal string, number-like, boolean, or null. It
  returns structured errors for offsets at or beyond EOF, whitespace-only tails,
  and unclassified leading bytes, without copying object bodies, stream bodies,
  dictionaries, arrays, strings, names, or numeric values.
- Adds `inspect_dictionary_extent`, a bounded single-pass helper for
  caller-provided bytes and a byte offset that begins a dictionary (typically
  the `first_token_byte_offset` reported for a `DictionaryOpen`). It skips
  optional PDF whitespace, requires the first significant token to be the `<<`
  dictionary-open delimiter, and tracks `<<`/`>>` nesting depth so the reported
  close is the matching close of the outermost `<<`, not the first inner `>>`.
  It reports the open `<<` offset, the closing `>>` offset, the exclusive
  byte offset after the close, and the deepest observed nesting depth. Literal
  strings `( ... )` (honoring `\` escapes and balanced unescaped parentheses),
  hex strings `< ... >` (a `<` not followed by `<`), and `%` comments are
  skipped as opaque spans so `<<`, `>>`, `>`, and `<` bytes inside them never
  affect the depth count. A private `MAX_DICTIONARY_NESTING_DEPTH` constant
  bounds pathological inputs: exceeding it yields a structured
  `MaxNestingExceeded` rejection rather than unbounded work. The helper decodes
  no key, value, name, number, or string contents, and never retains or copies
  PDF bytes; it reports only byte offsets and the depth scalar. It returns
  structured errors for offsets at or beyond EOF, whitespace-only tails, a first
  token that is not `<<`, an unterminated literal or hex string, and an
  unterminated dictionary.
- Adds `inspect_array_extent`, a bounded single-pass helper for caller-provided
  bytes and a byte offset that begins an array (typically the
  `first_token_byte_offset` reported for an `ArrayOpen`). It skips optional PDF
  whitespace, requires the first significant token to be the `[` array-open
  delimiter, and tracks `[`/`]` nesting depth so the reported close is the
  matching close of the outermost `[`, not the first inner `]`. It reports the
  open `[` offset, the closing `]` offset, the exclusive byte offset after the
  close, and the deepest observed nesting depth. Literal strings `( ... )`
  (honoring `\` escapes and balanced unescaped parentheses), hex strings
  `< ... >` (a `<` not followed by `<`), and `%` comments are skipped as opaque
  spans so `]` bytes inside them never affect the depth count. A `<<` dictionary
  open is advanced past as a nested-dictionary delimiter so its leading `<` is
  not misread as a hex-string open; only `[`/`]` delimiters drive the depth
  count. A private `MAX_ARRAY_NESTING_DEPTH` constant bounds pathological
  inputs: exceeding it yields a structured `MaxNestingExceeded` rejection rather
  than unbounded work. The helper decodes no element, name, number, or string
  contents, and never retains or copies PDF bytes; it reports only byte offsets
  and the depth scalar. It returns structured errors for offsets at or beyond
  EOF, whitespace-only tails, a first token that is not `[`, an unterminated
  literal or hex string, and an unterminated array. It lives in its own
  `array_extent.rs` module and leaves `inspect_dictionary_extent` and
  `inspect_indirect_object_body_token` unchanged.
- Adds `inspect_classic_xref_trailer_dictionary`, a pure composition helper for
  caller-provided bytes and a classic xref `trailer` keyword offset. It skips
  optional PDF whitespace at the caller offset, validates the resolved
  `trailer` keyword with shared keyword-boundary rules, skips optional
  whitespace after it through `inspect_dictionary_extent`, and reports only the
  caller offset, resolved trailer keyword offset, dictionary open/close/after
  offsets, and maximum observed dictionary nesting depth. It returns structured
  public errors for offsets at or beyond EOF, missing `trailer` keywords, and
  delegated dictionary-extent rejections, without parsing trailer keys such as
  `/Size`, `/Root`, or `/Prev`.
- Adds `inspect_dictionary_entries`, a bounded shallow scanner for
  caller-provided bytes and a dictionary-open byte offset. It first validates
  and bounds the outer dictionary through `inspect_dictionary_extent`, then
  scans only between the outer `<<` and its matching `>>` for top-level
  `/Name value` pairs. Each entry reports key and value byte ranges plus a
  shallow value kind (`dictionary`, `array`, `name`, `string`, `number_like`,
  `boolean`, `null`, `indirect_reference_like`, or `other_scalar`) without
  retaining or copying key/value bytes. Nested dictionaries and arrays are
  skipped as opaque values through the existing extent helpers, while literal
  strings, hex strings, and comments are treated as opaque spans so delimiters
  inside them do not split top-level entries. Scalar scanning recognizes
  `N G R`-shaped values as one indirect-reference-like span but does not resolve
  or interpret references or any specific dictionary key semantics. The helper
  returns structured public errors for malformed non-name top-level keys,
  missing values, delegated dictionary/array extent failures, and unterminated
  string spans.
- Adds `parse_indirect_reference`, a bounded report-only helper for
  caller-provided bytes and a byte offset that begins an `N G R` indirect
  reference (typically the `value_range.start` of a `DictionaryEntrySpan`
  classified as `IndirectReferenceLike`). It skips optional PDF whitespace over
  a fixed leading window (`INDIRECT_REFERENCE_SCAN_LIMIT`), parses
  `object-number generation R`, and reports the parsed `IndirectRef`, the
  resolved reference start, the byte range through the `R` keyword, and the byte
  immediately after `R`. It is the direct sibling of
  `inspect_indirect_object_header`: same `N G <keyword>` discipline, but the
  keyword is `R`, validated with the shared keyword-boundary rule
  (`consume_keyword`) so `Robot` or `R0` is not accepted and an `N G obj` header
  (or any other trailing keyword) is rejected as malformed rather than parsed as
  a reference. It validates public numeric ranges and returns structured errors
  for offsets at or beyond EOF (`OffsetOutOfBounds`), malformed `N G R` shape
  (`MalformedReference`), an object number that does not fit `u32`
  (`ObjectNumberOutOfRange`), and a generation that does not fit `u16`
  (`GenerationOutOfRange`), mirroring the header helper's rejection style. It
  retains or copies no PDF bytes, allocates nothing beyond the fixed-size public
  report, and does not resolve or follow the reference, inspect the referenced
  object's header or body, or read any dictionary, array, stream, trailer, or
  `/Prev` chain. It lives in its own `indirect_reference.rs` module. A
  composition test chains `inspect_classic_xref_table ->
  inspect_classic_xref_trailer_dictionary -> inspect_dictionary_entries ->
  parse_indirect_reference` over synthetic classic-xref bytes, parsing the
  `/Root` entry's `IndirectReferenceLike` value span into an `IndirectRef` and
  feeding its object number to `resolve_classic_xref_object` to locate the
  catalog object's byte offset without inspecting the catalog body.
- Adds `inspect_classic_xref_trailer_root`, a focused composition helper for
  caller-provided bytes and a classic xref `trailer` keyword offset. It
  delegates trailer dictionary location to `inspect_classic_xref_trailer_dictionary`,
  scans top-level trailer entries with `inspect_dictionary_entries`, matches
  only the exact raw top-level key bytes `/Root`, and parses the selected value
  with `parse_indirect_reference`. The report carries the delegated trailer
  dictionary offsets, `/Root` key and value byte ranges, and the parsed
  `IndirectRef`; it does not retain or copy trailer bytes, object bodies,
  stream bodies, catalog dictionaries, page trees, or referenced-object bytes,
  and it does not resolve the root reference. Structured public rejections cover
  delegated trailer dictionary failures, delegated dictionary entry failures,
  missing `/Root`, duplicate exact `/Root` keys, direct non-reference values
  such as dictionaries/names/numbers, and malformed scalar reference attempts
  such as `1 0 obj`.
- Adds `inspect_indirect_object_dictionary`, a focused composition helper for
  caller-provided bytes and an indirect object byte offset (typically a
  `ClassicXrefObjectLocation::InUse` offset). It is the object-level sibling of
  `inspect_classic_xref_trailer_dictionary`: where that helper bridges a
  `trailer` keyword to a dictionary, this one bridges an `N G obj` header to a
  dictionary-bodied object's top-level entries. It composes existing bounded
  inspectors only: it resolves the header with `inspect_indirect_object_header`,
  classifies the body's leading token with `inspect_indirect_object_body_token`,
  requires that token to be the dictionary-open `<<`, then scans top-level
  `/Name value` spans with `inspect_dictionary_entries` at the reported
  first-token offset. The report carries the resolved header byte range and
  parsed `IndirectRef`, the dictionary open/close/after offsets, the maximum
  observed dictionary nesting depth, and the delegated `Vec<DictionaryEntrySpan>`;
  it retains or copies no PDF bytes, object bodies, stream bodies, key bytes, or
  value bytes (keys and values stay addressed by range). Structured public
  rejections distinguish a delegated header-inspection failure (`Header`), a
  delegated body-token classification failure including offsets at or beyond EOF
  surfaced by that helper (`BodyToken`), a non-dictionary body leading token such
  as an array/name/number/string/boolean/null (`NonDictionaryBody` carrying the
  classified `IndirectObjectBodyLeadingTokenKind`), and a delegated
  dictionary-entry inspection failure (`DictionaryEntries`). It interprets no
  keys such as `/Type`, `/Pages`, `/Kids`, `/Count`, or `/Contents`, resolves no
  indirect references found in values, decodes no name escapes or key/value
  bytes, and locates no `stream`/`endstream`/`endobj`/`/Length` or object body
  end beyond the dictionary extent. It lives in its own `object_dictionary.rs`
  module. A composition test chains `inspect_classic_xref_table ->
  resolve_classic_xref_object -> inspect_indirect_object_dictionary` over
  synthetic classic-xref bytes, locating a catalog-shaped object and a page-tree
  root object and reporting their top-level entry keys (`/Type`, `/Pages`,
  `/Kids`, `/Count`) as spans without copying their bytes.
- Adds `inspect_catalog_pages`, a focused composition helper for
  caller-provided bytes and an already-located catalog object byte offset. It
  delegates catalog-shaped object inspection to
  `inspect_indirect_object_dictionary`, matches only the exact raw top-level
  key bytes `/Pages`, and parses the selected value through
  `parse_indirect_reference`. The report carries the delegated object
  dictionary inspection, `/Pages` key and value byte ranges, and the parsed
  page-tree root `IndirectRef`; it retains or copies no PDF bytes, object
  bodies, stream bodies, page-tree dictionaries, page dictionaries, contents
  streams, or referenced-object bytes. Structured public rejections cover
  delegated catalog dictionary failures, missing `/Pages`, duplicate exact
  `/Pages` keys, direct non-reference values such as dictionaries/names/numbers,
  and malformed scalar reference attempts such as `2 0 obj`. This slice does
  not validate `/Type /Catalog`, decode name escapes, resolve the parsed
  `/Pages` reference, traverse `/Kids`, inspect `/Count`, page dictionaries,
  `/Contents`, resources, annotations, inherited attributes, streams, xref
  streams, object streams, encryption, linearization, incremental updates, or
  `/Prev` chains.
- Adds `inspect_page_tree_node`, a focused composition helper for
  caller-provided bytes and an already-located page-tree node object byte offset
  (typically the target of a catalog `/Pages` reference). It delegates
  page-tree-node object inspection to `inspect_indirect_object_dictionary`,
  matches only the exact raw top-level key bytes `/Kids` and `/Count` from each
  entry's `key_range`, validates the shallow `/Kids` value kind as `array`, and
  bounds that array value with `inspect_array_extent` at the value range start.
  The report carries the delegated `IndirectObjectDictionaryInspection`, the
  `/Kids` key/value byte ranges, the delegated `ArrayExtentInspection` for the
  `/Kids` value (open/close/after offsets and observed nesting depth), and the
  `/Count` key/value byte ranges; it retains or copies no PDF bytes, object
  bodies, stream bodies, page dictionaries, contents streams, `/Kids` array
  elements, or referenced-object bytes, reporting only byte ranges, offsets, and
  the depth scalar. Structured public rejections distinguish a delegated
  object-dictionary failure (`NodeDictionary`), missing `/Kids` (`MissingKids`),
  duplicate exact `/Kids` (`DuplicateKids`), a non-array `/Kids` value
  (`NonArrayKidsValue`), a delegated `/Kids` array-extent failure
  (`KidsArrayExtent`), missing `/Count` (`MissingCount`), duplicate exact
  `/Count` (`DuplicateCount`), and a non-number-like `/Count` value
  (`NonNumberCountValue`). The standalone `inspect_array_extent` call is what
  populates the report's `kids_array_extent`; because
  `inspect_indirect_object_dictionary` already bounds array values through
  `inspect_dictionary_entries`, an unterminated `/Kids` array currently fails at
  that delegated step and surfaces its array-extent rejection reason through the
  `NodeDictionary` channel, while `KidsArrayExtent` remains the dedicated error
  channel for the bounding call. Non-goals for this slice: it does not scan
  `/Kids` array elements into indirect references (it only bounds the array),
  parse the `/Count` integer (it confirms only the shallow number-like value
  kind and reports its byte range), descend into child page-tree nodes or page
  objects, resolve `/Kids` references, follow `/Parent`, require or decode
  `/Type /Pages`, decode name escapes, inspect page dictionaries, `/Contents`,
  `/MediaBox`, resources, annotations, or inherited attributes, or follow
  `/Prev` chains, xref streams, object streams, encryption, linearization, or
  incremental updates. It lives in its own `page_tree_node.rs` module. A
  composition test chains `inspect_classic_xref_table ->
  inspect_classic_xref_trailer_root -> resolve_classic_xref_object ->
  inspect_catalog_pages -> resolve_classic_xref_object -> inspect_page_tree_node`
  over synthetic bytes to bound the `/Kids` array and locate `/Count` without
  scanning array elements.
- Adds `inspect_page_tree_kids`, a focused composition helper for
  caller-provided bytes and an already-located page-tree node object byte
  offset. It delegates node boundary discovery to `inspect_page_tree_node`, then
  scans only the already-bounded `/Kids` array body between the outer `[` and
  matching `]` in a single forward pass. Direct top-level `N G R` entries are
  parsed through the existing `parse_indirect_reference` helper, preserving its
  keyword-boundary and numeric-range checks. The report carries the delegated
  `PageTreeNodeInspection`, direct kid `IndirectRef` values with
  `IndirectReferenceByteRange`s, and shallow skipped-entry diagnostics; it
  retains or copies no PDF bytes, array bytes, child object bytes, page
  dictionaries, contents streams, or referenced-object bytes. Nested arrays,
  dictionaries, literal strings, hex strings, comments, names, numbers,
  booleans, nulls, and other direct scalar values are not descended into or
  interpreted as child references. Malformed direct reference-shaped candidates
  are reported as `SkippedPageTreeKidKind::MalformedIndirectReference` with the
  delegated `IndirectReferenceInspectionRejection` rather than disappearing or
  panicking. The only owned allocations are the public report vectors for direct
  kid references and skipped direct entries; no benchmark was added because this
  remains a bounded single-array scan rather than a broader traversal.
- Adds `inspect_page_tree_node_type`, a focused composition helper for
  caller-provided bytes and an already-located page-tree object byte offset. It
  delegates top-level entry discovery to `inspect_indirect_object_dictionary`,
  matches the single exact raw top-level key bytes `/Type` from each entry's
  `key_range`, validates the shallow `/Type` value kind as `name`, and
  classifies the value's exact raw bytes into a `PageTreeNodeType`: `Pages` for
  `/Pages` (intermediate node), `Page` for `/Page` (leaf page), or `Other` for
  any other name value. The report carries the delegated
  `IndirectObjectDictionaryInspection`, the `/Type` key and value byte ranges,
  and the classified node kind; it retains or copies no PDF bytes, object
  bodies, stream bodies, page dictionaries, contents streams, or `/Type` name
  bytes, and an `Other` value stays addressed by `type_value_range`. The
  classifier compares only exact raw bytes and decodes no PDF name escapes, so
  an escaped form such as `/Page#73` classifies as `Other`, not `Page`. It never
  resolves references, follows `/Kids`, `/Parent`, or `/Contents`, descends into
  child page-tree nodes or page dictionaries, or reads any key other than
  `/Type`. Structured public rejections distinguish a delegated object-dictionary
  failure (`ObjectDictionary`), missing `/Type` (`MissingType`), duplicate exact
  `/Type` (`DuplicateType`), and a non-name `/Type` value (`NonNameTypeValue`),
  mirroring the `inspect_page_tree_node` / `inspect_catalog_pages` rejection
  style. It lives in its own `page_tree_node_type.rs` module with a private
  module-local `find_unique_entry` helper rather than widening the existing
  private one. A composition test chains `inspect_classic_xref_table ->
  inspect_classic_xref_trailer_root -> resolve_classic_xref_object ->
  inspect_catalog_pages -> resolve_classic_xref_object ->
  inspect_page_tree_node_type` over synthetic bytes to classify a located
  page-tree root as `/Pages`.
- Ablation T073: removes an unreachable `OffsetOutOfBounds` remapping from the
  page-tree-kids scanner's successful `parse_indirect_reference` branch. The
  shared indirect-reference parser already bounds successful reports to the
  input slice, so a parsed reference that extends past the bounded `/Kids` array
  body remains the existing `MalformedReference` skipped-entry diagnostic.
- Promotes the shared `parse_u64_decimal` decimal parser into `source_utils` so
  the indirect-reference and object-header helpers reuse one bounded
  decimal-to-`u64` routine instead of duplicating it.
- Ablation: factors the identical `N G <keyword>` scan shared by
  `inspect_indirect_object_header` and `parse_indirect_reference` into a single
  internal `parse_object_reference_shape` helper in `source_utils` (parametrized
  by scan window and trailing keyword). Each public helper now only maps the
  shared `ObjectReferenceShape`/rejection into its own report and error types, so
  the bounded single-pass scan, whitespace/digit/keyword-boundary discipline, and
  numeric-range checks live in one place instead of two near-verbatim copies.
  Behavior, public types, field names, serde shapes, and error offsets are
  unchanged; this only removes duplication.
- Shares literal-string, hex-string, and `%`-comment opaque-span skip helpers
  through the internal `source_utils` module so the string/comment scanning
  rules live in one place alongside the existing whitespace/delimiter helpers.
- Reports malformed or unsupported source shape through structured public
  rejection and diagnostic enums without retaining or copying PDF bytes.
- The only owned allocations introduced by classic table inspection are the
  public report vectors for subsection and entry metadata; no PDF bytes, object
  bodies, stream bodies, or trailer dictionary bytes are copied into reports.
- Splits source inspection internals into focused modules for bounded source
  orchestration, final `startxref` inspection, xref-section classification,
  classic xref table inspection, and shared byte-scanning helpers. Public
  crate-root re-exports and report/error shapes remain unchanged.
- Reuses the shared byte-scanning helpers for indirect-object header inspection
  so whitespace, digit, and keyword boundary rules stay in one internal module.
- Moves source and classic xref table regression coverage into focused
  `src/tests/source.rs` and `src/tests/classic_xref.rs` modules.
- Adds a Criterion benchmark target, `pdf_source`, covering synthetic classic
  xref table inspection throughput.
- Models indirect-object edit ownership as proven single-use, shared, or
  unproven, with a pure helper that permits in-place mutation only for exactly
  one proven owning consumer.
- Does not yet open files, parse trailer dictionaries, xref streams, objects,
  streams, page trees, or catalogs; it does not decode streams, mutate bytes,
  or connect to inventory/action planning.

## Follow-Ups

- Keep full PDF file parsing deferred until syntax, graphics-state, inventory,
  selectors, and planning/action slices have stable contracts.
- Build future object access on the source-inspection boundary without widening
  this report into whole-file eager parsing. Trailer dictionary parsing,
  `/Type /XRef`, `/W`, `/Index` stream dictionary handling, stream-body
  decoding, and `/Prev` incremental chains remain deferred.
- Use the ownership decision model before future write planning mutates any
  indirect object that may be referenced by more than one consumer.
